# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. You can read more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about). I find solving these puzzles as fun and have written code to solve these puzzles. This repo contains the code that I used to solve the daily puzzles.
